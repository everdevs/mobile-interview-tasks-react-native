# Mobile Engineer Challenge
A basic [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started) application with a series of challenges to complete.

We ideally want to develop against either an iOS or Android emulator that Metro will hook into. As a mobile engineer, we assume you already have these set up on your machine.

## Setup

### Install
```bash
yarn
```

### iOS
```bash
yarn ios 
```

### Android
```bash
yarn android 
```
